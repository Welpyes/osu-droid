==================

# Additions

- Add beatmap attribute display <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - Can be displayed by pressing the text with difficulty values (CS, AR, OD, HP, star rating) in song select.

# Changes

- Do not update OD value when using Precise mod in song select <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - It's the hit window that is different, not the OD, so attempting to "pair" OD like this is conceptually wrong.

# Bug Fixes

- Fix potential crash when canceling gameplay loading while slider paths are being loaded <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Fix non-host players being able to change required mods' settings in free mod <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Fix score overflow when playing a beatmap with information that has not been fully populated <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - Full population happens in background difficulty calculation. This bug happens when a player plays a beatmap with
    the ScoreV2 mod enabled and with the beatmap not being calculated yet.
